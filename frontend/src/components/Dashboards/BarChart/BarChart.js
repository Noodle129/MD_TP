Bar charts showing the average concentration
of each pollutant across all locations or for
 specific locations. This can help compare the
  pollutant concentrations across different
  locations. You could use a horizontal bar
  chart to show the average concentration of
  each pollutant for each location.

Scatter plots showing the relationship between
different pollutants. This can help identify
any correlations between different pollutants.
 You could use a scatter plot to show the
 relationship between the concentration of NO2
 and PM10 for each location.

 Donut chart: You could create a donut chart to
 show the proportion of each pollutant in the
 total pollution for each location. To do this,
 you would need to calculate the sum of all
 pollutant concentrations for each location,
 and then calculate the proportion of each pollutant
 relative to the total pollution. A donut chart can
 then be used to visualize these proportions.
 However, note that donut charts are not always
  the best way to show proportions, as they can be
  difficult to read accurately.

  Radar chart: A radar chart could be used to
  compare the concentration of different
  pollutants across all locations. To create a radar
  chart, you would need to normalize the concentration
  values for each pollutant across all locations so that
   they have a common scale. You could then plot the
   normalized values for each pollutant as a line on a
    radar chart, with each location represented by a
    different line. However, note that radar charts can
    be difficult to read accurately, especially when there
     are many variables being compared.
